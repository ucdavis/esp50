        In the late 1960s, the citizens of California were becoming increasingly concerned about their Stateâ€™s resources. In response to this concern, the University of California, Davis, submitted a proposal to the Rockefeller Foundation to create the Division of Environmental Studies. This funding led to the formation of the Division of Environmental Studies in 1970.
